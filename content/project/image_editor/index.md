This library aims to provide its users with basic image processing operations along with ways to compress the images.
Currently the following operations are supported:

1. RGB to Grayscale
2. Horizontal and Vertical Flip

Support for more operations are welcome!

Image compression is done using the k-means algorithm, pixel values are grouped together to form bands of pixels, hence making it more compressable for JPEG and other methods of compression.
