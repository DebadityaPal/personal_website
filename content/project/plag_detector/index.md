With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is observing a shift in the paradigm of the system of education as more institutions adopt online and cloud-based systems of teaching and evaluation. However, this change comes with its pitfalls, one of the most prominent being the inability to check for plagiarism effectively in answer sheets, especially if it is handwritten. Our proposed software involves an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that can extract textual data from scanned images of pages with handwritten information on them. Then the extracted data is checked for plagiarism against a database of approximately 130 trillion web pages, and a final report is generated.
