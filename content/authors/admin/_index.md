I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Being a connoiseur of sci-fi movies, I always found Artificial Intelligence highly interesting. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Semantic Parsing and Information Retrieval.

Currently I am working on detecting [Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL)](https://sites.google.com/view/pcl-detection-semeval2022/) in paragraphs of text and designign a model to reduce the amount of PCL whilst keeping the informative content of a paragraph intact. In the summer of 2022, I worked with [Dr. David R Traum](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Traum/David) to design a new dialogue management architecture. Previously, I have tackled the [NL2SQL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9417888) semantic parsing task with a couple of my colleagues and also worked on OCR enabled Plagiarism Checkers. I have also worked with [Dr. Debanjan Sadhya](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Dr.Devanjan) and [Prof. Shashikala Tapaswi](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Prof.Shashikala) to design OCR based Plagiarism Detectors.
