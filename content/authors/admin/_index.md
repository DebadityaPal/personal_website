I am a graduate student at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) majoring in Computer Science. Being a connoiseur of sci-fi movies, I always found Artificial Intelligence highly interesting. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Dialog Systems and Information Retrieval.

Currently I am working on creating Multilingual Open-Domain Negotiation Agents. I am also a research assistant at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, under the supervision of [Dr. David R Traum](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Traum/David), where I work on extracting context rich embeddings for dialog systems. In the summer of 2022, I worked with the same lab to design a new dialogue management architecture. Previously, I have tackled the [NL2SQL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9417888) semantic parsing task with a couple of my colleagues and also worked on OCR enabled Plagiarism Checkers. I have also worked with [Dr. Debanjan Sadhya](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Dr.Devanjan) and [Prof. Shashikala Tapaswi](https://www.iiitm.ac.in/index.php/en/component/splms/teacher/Prof.Shashikala) to design OCR based Plagiarism Detectors.
